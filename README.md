## Piscine C

Every day for four weeks and even on weekends, we have to do exercises and
projects in C. Prior to this I some knowledge of javascript, html and css,
which helped but it was tough due to the nature of the C language.

*Disclaimer: I've fixed a lot of the exercises, and made new solutions
to previous ones that I didn't completed during my piscine.
These scores don't show the final mark of this repository.*

### TODO
  Revise some exercises
  when I have time.
