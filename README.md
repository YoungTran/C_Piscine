# 42 Silicon Valley

## Piscine C

Every day for four weeks and even on weekends, we have to do exercises and
projects in C. Prior to this I some knowledge of javascript, html and css,
which helped but it was tough due to the nature of the C language.

*Disclaimer: I failed most days due to structure of the Piscine grading
but I did well enough to be accepted into 42!*

## TODO
When time allows I will revise 
the exercises.
