# 42 Silicon Valley

## Piscine C

Every day for four weeks including weekends we had to
do fundamental exercises and projects in C. Prior to 
this I some knowledge of javascript, html and css, 
which helped but it was tough due to the nature of the C language.
It was one of most challenging things I've ever done in my life.
But I am extremely grateful because it taught me that if you work 
hard enough. You can accomplish anything you set out on doing.

*Disclaimer: I failed most days due to structure of the Piscine grading
but I did well enough and passed crucial exams to be accepted into 42!*

## TODO
When time allows I will revise 
the exercises.
